This is a Unsupervised Clustering using Python Machine Learning.

“Unsupervised Clustering” is a method for interpreting the structure of a dataset. Clustering is a Machine Learning algorithm used in everything from Computer Vision to Bioinformatics.

Here is an example of a dataset that was made up of a large number of data points. When performing Unsupervised Clustering, we seek to assign each point of data to a cluster, learning where the clusters are, and which data points belong to which clusters.

The two variables we have measured are Birth Rate (the number of children born per 1000 people each year), and Life Expectancy (how long someone lives on average after being born). Measuring these two variables let each country be placed on a two-dimensional plane, creating a graph known as a “scatter plot” 

The “k-means” clustering ​algorithm is used. This groups up all of the points to the nearest cluster. Instead of having sevearal points scattered all over the graph, they are colour coded with other points which are in the same group.

I used the points on Microsoft Excel to make the graphs. There are 3 graphs: 1953, 2008 and both.

This shows the points of the diagram on Python.

You have 3 options to choose which graph to view.

By looking at these graphs you can see the life expentancy is increasing and the birth rate slowly increasing as well.
